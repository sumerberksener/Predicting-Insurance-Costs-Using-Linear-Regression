# Predicting-Insurance-Costs-Using-Linear-Regression
I used data visualisation techniques such as boxplots and kernel density plots during exploratory data analysis. I also used feature engineering to transform the data into a form that would be more useful when training our model. In this project I used linear regression to predict the insurance costs for each patient using data such as their age, BMI and whether they are a smoker or not. This type of machine learning could be very useful in the healthcare sector.

The data I used for this project could be obtained from the following [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance?resource=download) page. 

I trained a linear regression model on the training data and achieved an R2 score of 0.79 on the test data.
